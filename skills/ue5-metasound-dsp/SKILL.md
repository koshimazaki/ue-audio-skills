# MetaSounds DSP — Node Graphs & Signal Design

Design MetaSounds audio graphs: choose nodes, wire signal chains, configure DSP parameters, and generate Builder API command sequences.

## Data Types

Audio, Trigger, Float, Int32, Bool, Time, String, WaveAsset, UObject, Enum (+ Array variants)

**Type rules**: Audio-rate cannot connect to Float. Use correct node variant (e.g., `Multiply (Audio)` vs `Multiply (Float)`).

## Asset Types

| Type | Use | Interface |
|------|-----|-----------|
| **Source** | Standalone playable asset | UE.Source.OneShot or MetaSound |
| **Patch** | Reusable subgraph (no play) | Custom |
| **Preset** | Parameter overrides of existing Source/Patch | Inherits parent |

## Interfaces

- `MetaSound` — Standard audio output
- `UE.Source.OneShot` — OnPlay trigger in, OnFinished trigger out
- `UE.Attenuation` — Distance input for volume falloff
- `UE.Spatialization` — Azimuth/Elevation for 3D positioning

## Finding Nodes and Pins

- Look nodes up in the engine-synced catalogue, `src/ue_audio_mcp/knowledge/metasound_catalogue.json`, or with the `ms_search_nodes` and `ms_node_info` tools. They give the class name (e.g. `UE::Biquad Filter::Audio`) and the exact, typed pin names that `connect` expects.
- With the editor running, `list_node_classes` (TCP) lists everything the engine has registered, including plugin nodes.
- The Builder API is experimental: node classes and pins can change between UE versions, so re-sync the catalogue after an engine upgrade (`scripts/update_catalogue_pins.py`).
- `WaveAsset` inputs need a real imported sound in the project's Content folder.

## Signal Flow Patterns

### Basic: Generator → Envelope → Output
```
Sine → Multiply(Audio) × AD Envelope → Out Mono
```

### Subtractive: Osc → Filter → Amp → Output
```
Saw → Biquad Filter(LP) → Multiply × ADSR → Out Mono
         ↑ Cutoff Frequency
```

### Additive: Multiple Oscs → Mix → Output
```
Sine(f) + Sine(2f) + Sine(3f) → Add → Multiply × Envelope → Out
```

### Triggered: Event → Sample Player → Processing
```
OnPlay → Wave Player → Biquad Filter → Compressor → Out
                         ↑ Pitch Shift for variation
```

### Modulated: LFO → Parameter Control
```
LFO → Map Range(0-1 → 200-2000) → Biquad Filter Cutoff
```

Validated by 7-stage validator: required fields, asset_type, interfaces, node types, pin existence, type compatibility, required inputs, interface completeness.

## Design Guidelines

1. Choose asset type: Source (playable) or Patch (reusable subgraph)
2. Select interface: MetaSound (general), OneShot (fire-and-forget)
3. Design signal flow: Generator → Processing → Envelope → Mixing → Output
4. Expose parameters Blueprint needs to control as graph inputs
5. Use `SetNodeLocation()` for editor layout visibility
6. Validate with `ms_validate_graph` before sending to Builder API
7. Consider AudioLink if routing to Wwise for mixing

## Gotchas

- AD Envelope (Float) for modulation chains, AD Envelope (Audio) for amplitude
- Float→Audio connections are invalid. To scale audio by a float, use `Multiply (Audio by Float)`
- Pin names from Epic docs may use shorthand — always verify against the catalogue (`ms_node_info`)
- Node class names: use display names from knowledge DB, or full `Namespace::Name::Variant` for direct lookup
